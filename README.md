# Abaqus: Path from Nodeset

Script to generate a path in postprocessing from predefined nodesets


How to:
- Define path location in preprocessing by defining the nodesets
- Specify setnames in script
- Run script in postprocessing to create path



Notes:
- Paths can form a closed loop
- Script asks if the first node shall be added also as last node into the path
- Comment that portion of the script out if you don't need that
